# SPDX-Git-Scanner
The SPDX-Git-Scanner is aimed at processing branches from Git into SPDX documents. The utility will retrieve, scan, and return a single SPDX document back into the branch. Scanning is completed through the [doSOCS](https://github.com/socs-dev-env/DoSOCS) module and files are cached in a MySQL database through [SOCsDatabase](https://github.com/socs-dev-env/SOCSDatabase).
